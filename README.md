- Memory Leak
- Reference Counting
- Mark and Sweep

### Compiling the code

To run the code you need to have a C compiler, clang-format installed on your machine.

### Running tests

- To compile the code and run all tests, you can use the following command:

```bash
make test
```

- To compile the code and run mark and sweep tests, you can use the following
command:

```bash
make test-mas
```

- To compile the code and run all other tests, you can use the following
command:

```bash
